                    "expose_headers" :["ETag"],
                    "max_age_seconds": 3000,

        An S3 bucket policy string::

            aws.add_bucket(
                name="my-test-bucket",
                policy= json.dumps({
                    "Version":"2008-10-17",
                    "Statement":[{
                        "Sid":"AllowFullControlForBucketOwner",
                        "Effect":"Allow",
                        "Principal":{"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::111111111111:root"},
                        "Action":"s3:*",
                        "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::my-test-bucket/*"}],
                }),
            )


Adding files to buckets
-----------------------

Touchdown has basic support for pushing files to S3. This is lightweight and
basic. It's using for setting up things like crossdomain.xml::

    bucket = aws.add_bucket(name="my-test-bucket")
    bucket.add_file(
        name="crossdomain.xml",
        contents=open("crossdomain.xml").read(),
    )
